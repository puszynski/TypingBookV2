bugs:
When add new book - genre is not saved in DB


todo:
- save progress to logged users
- typingController as start - when not logged, standard start content; When logged - go to last page
- book page changing by roll the bar(?) or ..
- normal user / admin - when normal user add book as public - admin must approve it
- admin task - programs that can by run manualy by admin user (1) it will run thru all books and use "bookContentHelper.TransformeBookContent(model.Content)" and others methods to transorm actuall db data (e.g. when transform code logic will changed)

ideas:
